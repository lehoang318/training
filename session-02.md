* Processes
  * [Definitions](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.prog/topic/overview_Definitions.html)
    > A thread is a single flow of execution or control.

    > A process is a collection of resources shared by one or more threads

    > Each process lives in its own protected memory space. (QNX/An application as a set of processes)

    * [How do we override the default reactions?](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/s/signal.html)
      ```
      #include <signal.h>

      typedef typeof(void (int))  *sighandler_t;
      sighandler_t signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler);                          // ANSI C99 & POSIX

    * Is it possible to block signals? [sigprocmask()](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/s/sigprocmask.html)

    * How do we detect whether a process was terminated by a signal?
      * `WIFSIGNALED(stat_val)`: Evaluates to nonzero value if the child process terminated from reception of a signal that wasn't caught.
      * `WTERMSIG(stat_val)`: Evaluates to the number of the signal that terminated the child process if the value of `WIFSIGNALED(stat_val)` is nonzero.

    * Note: [The eight special signals cannot be ignored or caught](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.sys_arch/topic/ipc_Special_signals.html).

  * [**Shared memory**](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.sys_arch/topic/ipc_Shared_memory.html)
    > ... access to shared memory is in itself unsynchronized.

    > Shared memory is therefore most efficient when used for updating large amounts of data as a block.

    * Workflow
      * Host
        1. Create a shared memory region: [shm_open()](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/s/shm_open.html)
          > When a new shared memory object is created, the size of the object is set to zero.

        2. Set the memory object's size: [ftruncate()](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/f/ftruncate.html)
        3. Map the shared memory object into the virtual address space of the calling process: [mmap()](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.sys_arch/topic/ipc_mmap.html)
        4. Read/Write the shared memory region
        5. Unmap the shared memory object from the virtual address space of the calling process: [munmap()](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/m/munmap.html)
        6. Close the file descriptor allocated by `shm_open()` when it is no longer needed: [close()](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/c/close.html)
        7. Unlink the memory object to completely remove it: [shm_unlink](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/s/shm_unlink.html)

          * Note: `Unlink` could be done by another process.

      * Guest
        1. Open the existing shared memory object using its path name
        2. Map the shared memory object into the virtual address space of the calling process
        3. Read/Write the shared memory region
        4. Unmap the shared memory object from the virtual address space of the calling process: [munmap()](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/8.0/com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/m/munmap.html)
        5. Close the file descriptor allocated by `shm_open()` when it is no longer needed

  * `CLOCK_REALTIME`: the current calendar time/wall-clock (seconds since the Unix Epoch, 00:00:00 January 1, 1970)

  * Notes
    * `CLOCK_REALTIME` could be adjusted at runtime! => should not be used for profiling purposes!
    * "The OS actually just counts time since booting" => `Wall-clock time = Monotonic time + Offset`

## Sample Application
* One starter process spawn a list of child processes
  * Send signal to control execution flows of the child processes
  * Detect the termination of child processes
  * Hanle hanging child processes
